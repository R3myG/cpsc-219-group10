#summary Second Deliverable

= Test Documentation for the Second Deliverable =

For the second deliverable this is for the interface part: 

Using the Main class runs the interface part. This part was coded with eclipse in the package com.cpsc219g10.view. So the easiest way is to use eclipse. 
You can test this interface by using quit, rules of the game and the credits with “?”. 

"New" and "Score" have to be implemented

So the class workings are:
 * HomePanel => done
 * RulesPanel => done
 * Window => done 
 * ZContainer => done

In progress: 
 * GamePanel => need to be done
 * PlaceBoatPanel => need to be done
