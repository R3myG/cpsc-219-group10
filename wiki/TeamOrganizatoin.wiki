= Introduction =

The standard ways in which the team will interact and information will be exchanged.

= Details =

Team members are all responsible for the generation proofing and testing of there own and each others code. We have accesses to the code via a google code repository. We all have eclipse and we have linked our eclipse's via SVN to the google repository for uploading.  

Other documents and communications are done through Facebook including Facebook's new file transferring system.
